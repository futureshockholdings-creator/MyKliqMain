Email delivery confirmed working with 2-3 minute transmission delay. Button displays "HELP" text instead of message icon for clearer user guidance.

When holding a profile triggers the shaking animation and delete button, clicking anywhere outside the profile area now cancels the action and stops the animation, improving user experience and preventing accidental deletions.
- **Headlines Feed Cache Fix**: Resolved critical frontend caching issues that prevented new posts from displaying in headlines feed. Fixed TypeScript errors and browser cache problems, ensuring all 101+ kliq member posts display properly with realistic engagement patterns and diverse content types including photos, locations, workout updates, food posts, travel content, and YouTube links.
- **Kliq Name Removal from Posts**: Simplified author attribution in headlines feed by removing kliq name suffixes from user names.
