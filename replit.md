# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client is a React-based Single Page Application (SPA) using TypeScript, following a component-based design. It utilizes Vite for building, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for server state management, Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui for UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling, and React Hook Form with Zod for form handling.

## Backend Architecture
The server follows a RESTful API design using Express.js with TypeScript. It uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for the database layer, Replit-integrated OAuth for authentication, and PostgreSQL-backed sessions for session management.

## Database Design
PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database operations. Key tables manage users, user themes, friendships (with a 1-28 ranking hierarchy), posts, comments, content filters, messages, stories, sessions, and used invite codes.

## Authentication & Authorization
Authentication is integrated with Replit's OAuth system using OpenID Connect. Secure cookie-based sessions are stored in PostgreSQL. The system supports automatic user creation and management, and uses unique, one-time invite codes for friend connections.

## Content Management
The application features a sophisticated content system:
- **Hierarchical Feed**: Posts filtered by friend rankings and user-defined content filters.
- **Kliq-wide Content Aggregation**: Displays all kliq member content (posts, polls, events, actions) in the headlines feed with full interactivity.
- **Daily Content Features**: Includes daily horoscopes and bible verses with timezone-aware generation and one-click posting capabilities.
- **Real-time Polling**: Allows creation of polls with customizable time limits, vote tracking, and live percentage-based results.
- **Media Support**: Comprehensive photo, video, and YouTube URL embedding using object storage.
- **Stories**: 24-hour disappearing content.
- **Incognito Messaging (IM)**: Private direct messaging with rich media support and message auto-deletion.
- **Moviecons**: Custom video uploads for reactions and emotes.
- **Live Streaming ("Action")**: Real-time video streaming with chat and auto-posting to headlines.
- **Meetups**: GPS-based check-in posting to the Bulletin feed.
- **Event Auto-posting**: Automatically creates posts in the kliq feed when events are created or updated.

## UI Customization System
Extensive theming allows deep personalization:
- **Global Theme System**: Applies changes across the entire app using CSS variables.
- **Dynamic Themes**: Real-time theme switching.
- **Customization Options**: Includes background customization (solid colors, gradients, patterns), font customization, primary/secondary color schemes, and border styles.
- **"Surprise Me" Randomizer**: Generates random themes ensuring readability.
